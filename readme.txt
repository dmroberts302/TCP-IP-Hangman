To play hangman run server.py [port_num] first then run client.py [hostname] [port_num].
On the client side you are prompted to guess a letter in the word stored on the server.
This letter is sent to the server and if in word the updated word will be displayed on the client side.
You have seven chances to guess incorrect letters.
If you guess all the letters without using all your chances you win else you lose.
